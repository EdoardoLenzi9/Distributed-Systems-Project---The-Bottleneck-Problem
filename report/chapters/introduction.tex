\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

In this chapter we are going to describe accurately the problem and provide a possible 
solution (from the point of view of a Distributed Systems designer).\\


\section{The Problem}

The bridge has a \textbf{maximum capacity} $c \geq 1$ and a crossing time $t$. \\

Cars can send messages to adjacent cars (to the car in front and to the rear one); 
cars can also have the ability to speak with more than two other cars depending on the 
\textbf{power of their transmission medium} $p \geq 1$.\\

The initialization of a communication between two cars can be done unsing an 
\textbf{environment process} 
that returns the required references needed to start the message exchange.\\

So basically a car can only send messages to the $p$ cars in front and 
to the $p$ cars behind. We assume that the bridge length doesn't constitute an impediment 
for the communications (so even if the bridge was very long, however, 
the cars can send messages as if they were close).\\

For simplicity we assume that every car has the 
same dimensions expressed in an arbitrary length scale called \textbf{block} and 
\textbf{every measure is an integer} ($s$, $l$, $c$, $p$, etc.). \\

We assume that cars can have a failure at any moment and there are only 
three types of failures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{mechanical failure} (the car cannot move but can send help messages to the other cars)
    \item \textbf{link failure} (the car can move but cannot send any message)
    \item \textbf{system failure} (the car cannot move and cannot send messages)
\end{itemize}

We assume that a link failure is equivalent to a system failure cause the car cannot 
take any decision without the agreement of the others. 
In case of engine failure or system failure the car or another helping car must call 
a tow truck in order to remove the broken car 
(in this case we have to wait an \textbf{elimination time} $e$).
In case of failure the car behind has to wait until the tow truck removes the broken car.\\

We assume that a car cannot be malicius (must follow the algorithm) but the communication 
channel isn't secure so it is exposed to a \textbf{MIM} (man in the middle) attack 
(drop messages, edit messages, message injection, ...).\\

Finally we have to consider that in a distributed system a global up-to-date state 
or a global timing cannot exist; this implies that each car can have a partial 
and \textbf{inconsistent view} of the global environment and a \textbf{time drift} 
from the global time (for this reason the system cannot guarantee the FIFO ordering 
at all).

\section{Requirements}

The main requirements to be met are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fairness}
    \item \textbf{Fault tolerance}
    \item \textbf{Without starvation}
    \item \textbf{Without deadlock}
\end{itemize}
