\chapter{Project}\label{ch:project}

This chapter is devoted to the description of the general architectures, and specific algorithms.

\section{Logical architecture}
Describe the components of your systems: modules/objects/components/services.
For each component, describe the functionalities it implements, and by who is used.

\section{Protocols and algorithms}
Communication between components.  UML sequence diagrams go here.

Also, put here a detailed description of distributed algorithms used to solve specific problems of the project.

\section{Physical architecture and deployment}
Which nodes and platforms involved, and where each component is deployed.

\section{Development plan}
Since it is difficult to predict just how hard implementing a new system will be, you should formulate as a set of ``tiers,'' where the basic tier is something youâ€™re sure you can complete, and the additional tiers add more features, at both the application and the system level.
